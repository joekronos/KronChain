# KronChain

KronChain - an immutable trading track record audit system which has the potential to remove any trust issues between the investor and the trading team.

By storing the hash of each trade you make onto the blockchain immediately, you can keep an immutable record of everything youâ€™ve bought and sold to prove your results. Trade details can be shared exclusively with auditors and investors, or can be made public for all - either way, traders are now able to prove their trading results are real in a costless and reliable way.

The beta version of TxChain is being offered exclusively to Kronos key partners, but stay tuned for the open-source version to be released here.
